        I have a really complex situation and I need help figuring out my goals and priorities. 
        Let me explain everything in detail. I'm 28 years old and I'm currently working as a software 
        engineer at a mid-size company. I've been there for 3 years and while I like the technical 
        work, I'm not particularly passionate about the products we build. I've always been interested 
        in environmental sustainability and climate change, and I've been thinking about transitioning 
        to a career that's more aligned with my values. However, I also have student loans that I'm 
        still paying off, and I need to maintain a certain income level. I've been considering going 
        back to school for a graduate degree in environmental science or sustainable engineering, but 
        that would mean taking on more debt and potentially reducing my income for a few years. 
        Alternatively, I could try to transition within the tech industry to companies that focus on 
        clean technology or environmental solutions. I'm also interested in starting a side project 
        or even eventually my own company focused on sustainability, but I don't have much business 
        experience. On the personal side, I want to buy a house in the next few years, and I'm in a 
        long-term relationship where we're thinking about getting married and maybe having kids 
        eventually. I also want to travel more and spend time with family, but I feel like I'm always 
        too busy with work. I try to exercise regularly but I'm not very consistent, and I want to 
        get better at cooking healthy meals instead of ordering takeout all the time. I feel like I 
        have so many different goals and priorities that I don't know where to start or how to balance 
        everything. Some days I feel motivated and ready to make big changes, and other days I feel 
        overwhelmed and just want to stick with the status quo. Can you help me figure out how to 
        approach this situation and what my first steps should be?
