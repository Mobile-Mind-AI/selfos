# MVP Plan – July 2025

**Date:** 2025-07-01 – 2025-07-31

## 1. Objective
Deliver a production-ready SelfOS v0.1 MVP to early adopters by July 31, 2025. The MVP will showcase:
- Conversational life planning (chat interface)
- Core goal & task management (CRUD via backend + UI)
- Basic personal memory retrieval (RAG)
- Secure user authentication
- Local development and CI/CD pipelines

## 2. Scope
### In Scope
- User signup/login (JWT)
- Define data models: User, Goal, Task, MemoryItem
- REST API (FastAPI) for goals, tasks, memory
- AI orchestration for goal breakdown (ai-engine)
- Flutter frontend: Login, Chat UI, Task List
- Shared models & prompt templates (libs/shared-models, libs/prompts)
- Docker Compose for local dev
- GitHub Actions: build, lint, test, deploy to staging

### Out of Scope
- Storytelling/video generation
- Social sharing integrations
- RLHF training pipelines
- Third-party calendar/obsidian sync
- Multi-user collaboration
- Production-grade scaling & monitoring

## 3. Timeline & Milestones
### Week 1 (Jul 1–7): Infrastructure & Authentication
- [x] Initialize monorepo structure (apps/, libs/, infra/)
- [x] Docker Compose: Postgres, Redis, FastAPI, Flutter web
- [x] FastAPI auth endpoints: /register, /login, /me
- [x] JWT middleware + role-based access stub
- [x] CI workflow: lint (flake8, dart analyze), pytest, flutter test

### Week 2 (Jul 8–14): Data Models & Core API
- [x] Pydantic models: User, Goal, Task, MemoryItem
- [x] Alembic migrations for Postgres schema
- [x] CRUD endpoints: /goals, /tasks (list, get, create, update, delete)
- [x] Input validation + error handling
- [x] Unit tests for API handlers

### Week 3 (Jul 15–21): AI & Memory Engine
- [ ] Define prompt templates for goal decomposition (libs/prompts)
- [ ] ai-engine: implement orchestrator service to call OpenAI/GPT
- [ ] Memory service: integrate Pinecone (or local vector store)
- [ ] API endpoint /ai/decompose-goal
- [ ] Integration tests: simulate chat requests

### Week 4 (Jul 22–27): Frontend UI
- [ ] Flutter: Authentication screens (login, signup)
- [ ] Flutter: Chat interface wired to /ai/decompose-goal
- [ ] Flutter: Task list and detail views (CRUD via backend)
- [ ] State management (Provider or Riverpod)
- [ ] Styling and responsive layout for web & mobile
- [ ] Widget tests and smoke tests

### Final Days (Jul 28–31): Integration, QA & Launch
- [ ] End-to-end testing (Cypress or Flutter integration tests)
- [ ] Security review: JWT flow, CORS, input sanitization
- [ ] Performance tuning: API response < 2s for chat requests
- [ ] Staging deployment & smoke test
- [ ] Prepare release notes and onboarding guide
- [ ] Official MVP release: tag v0.1, publish docs, announce Slack/email

## 4. Resources & Roles
- **Backend Engineers**: FastAPI, Alembic, Python tests
- **AI Engineer**: Prompt design, OpenAI/GPT integration
- **Frontend Engineers**: Flutter, Dart, widget testing
- **DevOps**: Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, staging deploy
- **PM/Design**: UX flow, API contract, acceptance criteria

## 5. Risks & Mitigation
- **AI API latency** → implement request batching, caching responses
- **Docker dev environment drift** → lock images, pin dependencies
- **Authentication bugs** → peer review, add security tests
- **Feature creep** → enforce strict sprint scope, defer extra features

## 6. Metrics & Success Criteria
- **Delivery**: All milestones completed by July 31, 2025
- **Reliability**: 0 critical bugs in staging
- **Performance**: 90th percentile API latency < 2s
- **Usability**: QA sign-off on core flows (signup, chat, task)
- **Adoption**: ≥ 50 early adopters onboarded in first week
