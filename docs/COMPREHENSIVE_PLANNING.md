## 5. Documentation Consolidation Plan

### Current Documentation Issues
- **26+ scattered files** across the project
- **Inconsistent quality** (Grade D+ average)
- **Missing API documentation** 
- **Outdated setup instructions**
- **No unified developer onboarding**

### Consolidation Strategy

#### 5.1 Core Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md                 # Main project overview
├── GETTING_STARTED.md       # Quick start guide
├── API_REFERENCE.md         # Complete API documentation
├── ARCHITECTURE.md          # System design overview
├── DEPLOYMENT.md            # Production deployment guide
├── DEVELOPMENT.md           # Developer setup and workflows
├── SECURITY.md              # Security practices and guidelines
└── TROUBLESHOOTING.md       # Common issues and solutions
```

#### 5.2 Consolidation Actions
